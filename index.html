I am student at Ieseg School of Management. I practice riding and I love it. Also, I like being with my friends and discovering new things and new people. As a result, my passion is the travel.

   <h2>Travel 🌍</h2>
   </p>
Since my birth, I have been travelling a lot with my parents around the world. So, it’s the thing I prefer in the world and <strong>my dream is to go around the world</strong>.

    <h2>Horse Riding 🐴</h2>
    </p>
I love <strong>horse riding</strong> ! I do that since I was four years old and it's a big part of my life. I won the French championships twice. Also, actually, I have a horse.

  <h2>Spain 🇪🇸</h2>
  </p>
I love <strong>Spain</strong>. I have been travelling every year since birth and it's my favorite country. Later, I would like to live in Spain. My passion for Spain has led me to do the Bachibac, a double Franco-Spanish baccalaureate, and today I speak fluent Spanish.
